# LyricHunter
This is my final project for HCDE 310!


There have been so many instances in my life where I get a tune stuck in my head, but I can’t, for the life of me, remember the song it’s from. It typically eats away at me as I struggle to remember more lyrics as well, and I can’t search it up because I don’t know what song it is! 

This is why I wanted to create a website called the Lyric Hunter that allows users to input the chunk of words they remember from a song and get the output of possible songs it could be from. Along with each song title, it would show you where in that particular song’s lyrics your inputted words could be coming from. With that extra context, it would help the user identify their song even faster!

I used the Genius API, which provides access to lyrics of all songs in their database and can retrieve all song information for a specific song, including its title, artist, album, and other metadata, for this project.
